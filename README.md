## Story

AS a Homeowner, I want one location where I can track my household bills, chores, groceries, etc

SO I can quickly and easly find and maintain that information and get reminders when certain things need to be completed.

GIVEN a User who wants one location to track Bills, Events, Chores, and Groceries

WHEN a User navigates to ABODE

THEN they land on the home page, which contains a description of the app and how it works

WHEN a User logs in using their Google Account

THEN they are rerouted to the primary components of the App

WHEN a User is logged in via their Google Account

THEN the image associated with their account will display in the Nav Bar

WHEN a User is logged in

THEN they are given access to the calendar display and input fields for Events, Chores, Bills, and Groceries

WHEN a User inputs data

THEN it will immediately display in a list below and on the calendar above on the appropriate day

WHEN a User wants to switch to a different input and they click on one of the other options

THEN the corresponding input fields will render along with the list of any existing items from that field

WHEN a User wants a reminder of the App description

THEN that information is viewable in the collapsible Nav Bar

WHEN a User is done and wants to log out

THEN they click on the sign out button and they are rerouted to the Home page

## Retrospective

-Shonta: 

-Chris: This project was a lot of work but I am significantly more confident in my abilities regarding MERN stack development. Additionally, I feel confident finding an npm package for something I need (cookie parser and react-rounded-image for a couple examples I found and utilized for this project). I definitely need to practice some of the more complicated (to me) concepts but I feel I am now a capable full-stack developer with high potential for growth.

I've worked with each of the other teammates in previous projects so we already had a rapport together. This proved very helpful during the development process. I've enjoyed my time working with everyone on this project and I wish everyone success and good fortune!
